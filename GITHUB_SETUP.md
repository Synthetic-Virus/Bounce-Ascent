# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

Your Bounce Ascent project is ready to push to GitHub! Follow these steps:

## ✅ What's Already Done

- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ All project files committed
- ✅ `.gitignore` configured for Godot
- ✅ `.gitattributes` set for proper line endings
- ✅ LICENSE file (MIT)
- ✅ README.md with badges and documentation
- ✅ CONTRIBUTING.md for contributors
- ✅ Branch set to `main`

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

**Option A: Using GitHub CLI (gh)**
```bash
# If you have GitHub CLI installed
gh repo create Bounce-Ascent --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

**Option B: Using GitHub Web Interface**

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `Bounce-Ascent`
3. Description: `A challenging 2D endless platformer built with Godot`
4. Public or Private: Your choice
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these!)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Add Remote and Push (if using Option B)

After creating the repo on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
cd /home/virus/bounce-ascent

# Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Bounce-Ascent.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify Push

Once pushed, check your GitHub repository at:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Bounce-Ascent
```

You should see:
- All project files
- README with game description
- 29 files, ~2,500+ lines of code
- Initial commit message

## 🎨 Optional: Add Topics/Tags

On GitHub, add these topics to your repository (Settings → Topics):
- `godot`
- `godot-engine`
- `game-development`
- `platformer`
- `2d-game`
- `endless-runner`
- `gdscript`
- `open-source`

## 📸 Optional: Add Screenshots

Replace the placeholder in README.md:
1. Take a screenshot of gameplay (F12 in Godot)
2. Upload to `/assets/screenshots/` in your repo
3. Update README.md line 9:
   ```markdown
   ![Game Screenshot](assets/screenshots/gameplay.png)
   ```

## 🔐 Important Security Notes

**Encryption Keys:**
- The anti-cheat encryption keys are embedded in the code
- This is intentional for a client-side game
- If you want to change them, edit `scripts/GameManager.gd` lines 7-9

**Save Files:**
- User save files are NOT in this repository
- They're stored in OS-specific user data directories
- `.gitignore` prevents accidental commits

## 📊 Repository Stats

After pushing, your repo will show:
- **Language**: GDScript (~95%), GLSL (~5%)
- **Files**: 29
- **Lines**: ~2,500+
- **License**: MIT

## 🚀 After Pushing
