A challenging 2D endless platformer where you control a bouncing ball that must ascend endlessly higher while avoiding falling behind the scrolling screen.

## Game Features

### Core Gameplay
- **Rhythm-Based Bouncing**: Ball automatically bounces every 1.5 seconds
- **Timing System**: Press spacebar during timing windows for bonus height:
  - **PERFECT!** (Green/0.1s window): Maximum height boost
  - **CLOSE!** (Yellow/0.2s window): Good height boost
- **Combo System**: Successive successful timings increase:
  - Bounce speed (faster rhythm, down to 0.5s minimum)
  - Jump height (-50 velocity per combo level)
  - Visual feedback (combo counter in ball center)
- **Horizontal Movement**: Control left/right with arrow keys or WASD
- **Scrolling Camera**: Screen scrolls upward - don't fall behind!
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Game speeds up dramatically in space zone (600+ height)

### Platform Types

1. **Static Platforms** (Green) - Basic solid platforms
2. **Moving Platforms** (Yellow) - Oscillate horizontally
3. **Breakable Platforms** (Red) - Dissolve over 0.5s, player falls through at 80% dissolved
4. **Temporary Platforms** (Purple) - Flash warning then fall after 2 seconds

### Difficulty Progression

**Platform Tiers:**
- **Tier 1 (0-50 height)**: Static platforms only
- **Tier 2 (50-100)**: Moving platforms introduced (30% chance)
- **Tier 3 (100-150)**: Breakable platforms added (20% chance)
- **Tier 4 (150-200)**: Temporary platforms appear (15% chance)
- **Tier 5 (200+)**: Smaller platforms, larger gaps

**Visual Transitions:**
- **Sky (0-200)**: Light blue starting zone
- **Sunset (200-400)**: Orange/pink transition
- **Dusk (400-600)**: Purple twilight with emerging stars
- **Space (600+)**: Deep space with stars, 2x speed multiplier kicks in

**Speed Scaling:**
- Base scroll speed: 30 px/s
- Max scroll speed: 300 px/s (was 120)
- Space zone (600-1000 height): Progressive speed multiplier up to 2x

### Scoring System

Your score is calculated from:
- **Height Reached** √ó 10 points
- **Platforms Landed** √ó 5 points
- **Time Survived** √ó 2 points

### Statistics Tracked

- High Score
- Total Runs
- Total Height Reached
- Total Platforms Landed
- Platforms Broken
- Time Survived
- Edge Escape Attempts (trying to go off screen)
- Deaths
- Rage Quits (closing game during active session)

## Controls

- **Left/Right Arrow** or **A/D**: Move horizontally
- **Spacebar** or **Up Arrow** or **W**: Time your bounce (press during green/yellow timing windows)
- **ESC**: Return to menu / Quit game

### Timing Guide
- **Visual Ring**: White ring fills around ball showing bounce timer
- **Green Marker**: PERFECT timing window (0.2s before auto-bounce)
- **Yellow Marker**: CLOSE timing window (0.1s before auto-bounce)
- **Combo Counter**: Number inside ball shows current combo streak
- **Feedback Text**: "PERFECT!" or "CLOSE!" displays after successful timing

## Technical Features

### Visual Style
- **Geometric Shapes**: Circles (ball) and rounded rectangles (platforms)
- **Black Outlines**: 3px outlines on all game elements for visibility
- **Text Outlines**: All UI text has black outlines for readability on any background
- **Neon Color Palette**: Bright colors with customizable ball colors
- **Dynamic Background**: Smooth color transitions from sky ‚Üí sunset ‚Üí dusk ‚Üí space
- **Particle Effects**: Break particles when platforms shatter
- **Animated Feedback**:
  - CLOSE jumps: 1.2x scale + wiggle animation
  - PERFECT jumps: 1.5x scale + dramatic wiggle animation
  - Timing ring with color-coded windows
  - Combo burst effects

### Anti-Cheat Security

The game implements multiple layers of save file protection:

1. **Encryption**: AES-256 encryption of all profile data
2. **Checksums**: SHA-256 hash validation
3. **HMAC Signatures**: Cryptographic signing with embedded secret key
4. **Runtime Validation**: Physics and statistics validation
5. **Impossibility Detection**: Validates that stats correlate properly

Save files cannot be easily edited to cheat high scores!

### Profile System

All player data is stored in an encrypted profile file including:
- **Customization**: Username and ball color (8 preset colors)
- **High Score**: Best score achieved across all runs
- **Cumulative Statistics**: Total runs, height, platforms, time survived
- **Session History**: Detailed per-run statistics
- **Profile Editor**: In-game UI for customization and viewing stats
