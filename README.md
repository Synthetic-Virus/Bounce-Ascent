A challenging 2D endless platformer where you control a bouncing ball that must ascend endlessly higher while avoiding falling behind the scrolling screen.

## Game Features

### Core Gameplay
- **Auto-Jump Mechanic**: Ball automatically jumps every 2.5 seconds
- **Manual Jump**: Force a jump anytime with spacebar/up arrow (with cooldown)
- **Horizontal Movement**: Control left/right movement with arrow keys or WASD
- **Scrolling Camera**: Screen scrolls downward - don't fall behind!
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Game gets harder as you climb higher

### Platform Types

1. **Static Platforms** (Green) - Basic solid platforms
2. **Moving Platforms** (Yellow) - Oscillate horizontally
3. **Breakable Platforms** (Red) - Shatter after landing once
4. **Temporary Platforms** (Purple) - Disappear after a short time

### Difficulty Tiers

- **Tier 1 (0-50 height)**: Static platforms only
- **Tier 2 (50-100)**: Moving platforms introduced
- **Tier 3 (100-150)**: Breakable platforms added
- **Tier 4 (150-200)**: Temporary platforms appear
- **Tier 5 (200+)**: Smaller platforms, larger gaps, faster scroll speed

### Scoring System

Your score is calculated from:
- **Height Reached** √ó 10 points
- **Platforms Landed** √ó 5 points
- **Time Survived** √ó 2 points

### Statistics Tracked

- High Score
- Total Runs
- Total Height Reached
- Total Platforms Landed
- Platforms Broken
- Time Survived
- Edge Escape Attempts (trying to go off screen)
- Deaths
- Rage Quits (closing game during active session)

## Controls

- **Left/Right Arrow** or **A/D**: Move horizontally
- **Spacebar** or **Up Arrow** or **W**: Force a jump
- **ESC**: Quit game

## Technical Features

### Visual Style
- Simple geometric shapes (circles and rectangles)
- Neon color palette
- CRT monitor effect with:
  - Scanlines
  - Chromatic aberration
  - Vignette
  - Screen noise

### Anti-Cheat Security

The game implements multiple layers of save file protection:

1. **Encryption**: AES-256 encryption of all profile data
2. **Checksums**: SHA-256 hash validation
3. **HMAC Signatures**: Cryptographic signing with embedded secret key
4. **Runtime Validation**: Physics and statistics validation
5. **Impossibility Detection**: Validates that stats correlate properly

Save files cannot be easily edited to cheat high scores!

### Profile System

All player data is stored in an encrypted profile file including:
- Username and high score
- Cumulative statistics across all runs
- Session history

## Development

### Built With
- **Engine**: Godot 4.3
- **Language**: GDScript
- **Graphics**: Custom shaders (GLSL)
