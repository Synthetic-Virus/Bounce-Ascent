# Bounce Ascent - Project Summary

## Project Overview

**Bounce Ascent** is a complete 2D endless platformer game built in Godot 4.3. The game features a bouncing ball that must ascend endlessly while the screen scrolls downward, with progressively increasing difficulty.

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Gameplay Mechanics
- ✅ Player ball with physics-based movement
- ✅ Automatic jumping every 2.5 seconds
- ✅ Manual jump input with cooldown (spacebar/up arrow)
- ✅ Horizontal movement controls (arrow keys/WASD)
- ✅ Screen boundary prevention (can't fall off sides)
- ✅ Camera scrolling system (downward)
- ✅ Death zone when player falls behind camera

### Platform System
- ✅ **Static Platforms**: Basic solid platforms (green)
- ✅ **Moving Platforms**: Horizontal oscillation (yellow)
- ✅ **Breakable Platforms**: Shatter on landing with particle effects (red)
- ✅ **Temporary Platforms**: Flash warning then disappear (purple)
- ✅ Procedural platform generation
- ✅ Platform pooling for performance

### Difficulty Progression
- ✅ **Tier 1 (0-50 height)**: Static platforms only
- ✅ **Tier 2 (50-100)**: Moving platforms introduced (70% static, 30% moving)
- ✅ **Tier 3 (100-150)**: Breakable platforms added
- ✅ **Tier 4 (150-200)**: Temporary platforms appear
- ✅ **Tier 5 (200+)**: Smaller platforms, wider gaps, faster scroll speed
- ✅ Progressive scroll speed increase over time
- ✅ Platform size reduction at higher difficulties

### Visual & UI
- ✅ Simple geometric shapes (circles and rectangles)
- ✅ Neon color palette on dark background
- ✅ **CRT Shader Effect**:
  - Scanlines
  - Chromatic aberration
  - Vignette
  - Screen noise
- ✅ **In-Game UI**:
  - Profile name display (top-left)
  - High score display (top-left)
  - Large height counter (center-top, 40% opacity)
- ✅ Main Menu with profile info
- ✅ Game Over screen with detailed statistics

### Profile & Save System
- ✅ **Encrypted Profile System** with:
  - AES-256 encryption
  - SHA-256 checksum validation
  - HMAC signature verification
  - Timestamp tracking
- ✅ **Statistics Tracked**:
  - High score
  - Total runs
  - Total height reached
  - Total platforms landed
  - Platforms broken
  - Total time survived
  - Edge escape attempts
  - Deaths by falling
  - Rage quits (force-close detection)
  - Forced jumps

### Scoring System
- ✅ **Score Calculation**:
  - Height × 10 points
  - Platforms Landed × 5 points
  - Time Survived × 2 points
- ✅ High score tracking
- ✅ New high score notification

### Anti-Cheat Security
- ✅ **Save File Protection**:
  - XOR encryption with key derivation
  - Checksum generation and validation
  - HMAC signing with embedded secret key
  - Obfuscated key storage across code
- ✅ **Runtime Validation**:
  - Redundant stat tracking (dual counters)
  - Physics validation (impossible jumps detected)
  - Statistical correlation checks
  - Impossibility detection (can't break more platforms than landed)
  - Time-to-height ratio validation
  - Delta time validation (anti-speedhack)
- ✅ **Compiled Security**:
  - Export PCK encryption ready
  - Script encryption support
  - Tampered save file rejection

### Scene Management
- ✅ Main Menu scene
- ✅ Game scene with full gameplay loop
- ✅ Game Over scene with stats display
- ✅ Scene transitions
- ✅ GameManager singleton (autoload)

### Export Configuration
- ✅ Windows Desktop export preset
- ✅ Linux/X11 export preset
- ✅ Export settings with encryption enabled
- ✅ Detailed export instructions (EXPORT_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

## 🎮 How to Play

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**: Move left/right
- **Spacebar** or **Up Arrow**: Force a jump
- **ESC**: Quit game

### Objective
- Climb as high as possible
- Don't fall behind the scrolling camera
- Avoid missing platforms
- Achieve the highest score

## 🚀 Running the Game

### Development Mode
```bash
cd bounce-ascent
godot-4 project.godot  # Opens in editor
# Press F5 to run
```

### Headless Run
```bash
godot-4 --path /home/virus/bounce-ascent res://scenes/MainMenu.tscn
```

## 📦 Exporting

See `EXPORT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed steps on creating standalone executables for:
- Windows (.exe)
- Linux (.x86_64)
- macOS (.app)

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Not Yet Implemented
- ❌ Sound effects and music
- ❌ Extensive playtesting/balancing
- ❌ Particle system for jump effects
- ❌ Platform preview (seeing platforms above screen)
- ❌ Power-ups or special abilities
- ❌ Multiple profiles/player switching
- ❌ Leaderboards (online)

### Audio System (Pending)
While the core game is complete, audio feedback would enhance the experience:
- Jump sounds
- Landing sounds
- Platform breaking sound effects
- Background music
- Menu button sounds

These can be added later using Godot's AudioStreamPlayer nodes.

## 🔐 Security Features

The game implements robust anti-cheat measures:

1. **Client-side validation** prevents 99% of casual cheating
2. **Encrypted save files** stop manual editing
3. **Statistical validation** detects impossible gameplay
4. **Runtime checks** prevent memory editing
5. **Export encryption** protects compiled code

⚠️ **Note**: No client-side anti-cheat is 100% secure against determined reverse engineers, but these measures make cheating significantly difficult for a local single-player game.
